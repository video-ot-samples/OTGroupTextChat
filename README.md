# Opentok Group Text Chat Android Sample

## Setup
Before compiling and running the app, we need to setup the Opentok Configuration.

In the `Constants.kt` file, change the 'SERVER_URL' to your own heroku url. Please visit here:- https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/web/basic-video-chat/#server to know how to setup your Heroku url.

## Using The App
When the application starts, it will ask to input "room name" and your "name" to enter the chat room.

Users who join the same room will get connected to the same session and can text chat with each other.
